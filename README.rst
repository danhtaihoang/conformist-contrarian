Traveling wave in a three-dimensional array of conformist and contrarian oscillators
=============================================================================================

Abstract
-----------------------------
We consider a system of conformist and contrarian oscillators coupled locally in a three-dimensional cubic
lattice and explore collective behavior of the system. The conformist oscillators attractively interact with the
neighbor oscillators and therefore tend to be aligned with the neighborsâ€™ phase. The contrarian oscillators interact
repulsively with the neighbors and therefore tend to be out of phase with them. In this paper, we investigate
whether many peculiar dynamics that have been observed in the mean-field system with global coupling can
emerge even with local coupling. In particular, we pay attention to the possibility that a traveling wave may arise.
We find that the traveling wave occurs due to coupling asymmetry and not by global coupling; this observation
confirms that the global coupling is not essential to the occurrence of a traveling wave in the system. The traveling
wave can be a mechanism for the coherent rhythm generation of the circadian clock or of hormone secretion in
biological systems under local coupling.
